Question about Professional
- Is Mutong Li an immigration lawyer or professional in the immigration field?
There are three basic types of companies providing permanent resident application services:
Agents: They usually provide services that you are fully capable of doing yourself. They help you fill up your Form 4A and tell you the compulsory documents to provide. These are things you can easily learn online. You get no real value from their support. Why pay for something that user can do by themselves? 
Consultancies: Consultancies often work the same way as law firms do. They possess the expertise to process your permanent resident application and provide added value in the form of practical advice. Mutong Li specializes solely in acquiring Singapore PR. We possess a significant amount of knowledge and experience that can help user greatly. 
Law and Accounting firms: Law and accounting firms usually charge more than $5000. Their clients consist mostly of corporate entities. However, immigration is not their main business.

2.	However, there is lots of information / points need to be pay attention to, which may drive the application out comes to be success or failure. The applicants need those experience / information. That is what above organization are working on to provide this service offline.
3.	Please understand this App is to help people to increase their PR application approval rates in correct way. For example, give the information to enhance people skill set which Singapore Gov has repeated mentioned  but as a foreigner may not be aware of; Or avoid own tax bill which will drive to unwished impression for Singapore ICA.
